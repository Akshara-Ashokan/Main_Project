This project outlines the development of an Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) system for automated grading of Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) answer sheets using OpenCV
and Python. By utilizing computer vision techniques, the proposed system can effectively detect and process marked responses on answer sheets, enabling efficient and reliable grading for large-scale assessments. The implementation involves various steps such as image preprocessing, contour detection, and feature extraction to identify the marked regions. Additionally, machine learning algorithms are utilized to interpret and grade the responses based on predefined correct answers. The system aims to improve the speed and accuracy of grading processes, alleviating the workload of educators, while ensuring objective and consistent evaluation of MCQ assessments through the automation of OMR technology.
